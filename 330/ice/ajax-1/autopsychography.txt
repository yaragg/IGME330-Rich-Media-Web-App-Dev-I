AUTOPSYCHOGRAPHY

The poet is a faker
Who’s so good at his act
He even fakes the pain
Of pain he feels in fact.

And those who read his words
Will feel in his writing
Neither of the pains he has
But just the one they’re missing.

And so around its track 
This thing called the heart winds, 
A little clockwork train
To entertain our minds.

- Fernando Pessoa (himself)
Translated by Richard Zenith
