<h2>AUTOPSYCHOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>The poet is a faker<br/>
Who’s so good at his act<br/>
He even fakes the pain<br/>
Of pain he feels in fact.</p>

<p>And those who read his words<br/>
Will feel in his writing<br/>
Neither of the pains he has<br/>
But just the one they’re missing.</p>

<p>And so around its track <br/>
This thing called the heart winds, <br/>
A little clockwork train<br/>
To entertain our minds.</p>

<p>- Fernando Pessoa (himself)<br/>
Translated by Richard Zenith</p>
